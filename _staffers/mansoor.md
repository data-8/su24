bio: Hi everyone! I'm Mansoor, a rising sophomore majoring in Applied Math. Beyond the classroom, you'll often find me engrossed in a book, with Jeffrey Archer's "Kane and Abel" being my favorite. As an avid fan of epic fantasy series, 'House of the Dragon' and 'Game of Thrones' are my go-tos. Excited for a fantastic semester ahead and to get to know all of you better!
