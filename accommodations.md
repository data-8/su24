## Assignment Extensions

We understand that life happens and want to provide you with the support you need. If you need to request an extension, please fill out the [DATA 8 SP24 Extension Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIjB9LSxV7UPKdNrAWbPJWJMJqV05P3jyznuAtAqQPmB79EA/viewform?usp=sf_link) form. Submissions to this form will be visible only to the Course Directors and Grading Leads.

## DSP Accommodations

We will provide appropriate accommodations to all students enrolled in Berkeley’s [Disabled Students Program (DSP)](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/). To ensure that you receive the appropriate accommodations, please have your DSP specialist submit a letter confirming your status and accommodations.

If you’re not enrolled in DSP, or are in the process of being onboarded by DSP, you may still be eligible for accommodations. We also aim to provide fair and appropriate accommodations to any students who, because of extenuating circumstances, may need them. Please reach out to data8@berkeley.edu if this is the case and our DSP Lead will get back to you.

## Privacy

All DSP and accommodations-related materials for this course are kept in a repository separate from the rest of the course materials that is visible only to the instructors and selected Lead GSIs.

For any DSP and accommodations-related communications, please reach out to data8@berkeley.edu. This inbox will be visible to future members of course staff, so if you ever have a communication that you wish to remain private, let us know and we can delete the email exchange once the conversation is resolved.
